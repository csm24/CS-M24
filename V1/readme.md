# ChessEngine project
## My input to the Swansea University M24 MSc team development project to develop a Chess game.

All Java (throughout the project) is under package **swantech**

My parts revolve around the Chess Engine.

It relies heavily on the ITCK Chess Library (qv)

It uses the StockFish chess engine https://stockfishchess.org/

It uses a facade library "Stockfish Port for Java"  
at http://rahular.com/stockfish-port-for-java/  
and git https://github.com/rahular/chess-misc/tree/master/JavaStockfish  
which runs the engine and provides a simple interface
